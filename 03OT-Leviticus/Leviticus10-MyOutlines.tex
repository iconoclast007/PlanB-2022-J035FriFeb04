\textbf{Introduction: }It has been suggested that the most serious crimes in Christianity have occurred and occur in the realm of corrupt worship.  We see it is Acts 5, where Ananias and Saphira were killed for lying  to the church.  We see it in Exodus 32 where a false image was worshiped as God. Here the exacting and precise requirements for worship are trivialized. So be careful what you call worship. Be careful what you think has to be manifested for something to be worship (and is not without).
