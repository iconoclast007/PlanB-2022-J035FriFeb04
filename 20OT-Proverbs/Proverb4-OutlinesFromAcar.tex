%\subsubsection{Guard Your Heart}
%\textbf{Introduction: }Fairweather Mountain is one of the most spectacular mountains North America. Located off the southeast coast of Alaska, the mountain reaches 15,000 feet above sea level. Massive granite walls with deep ravines cut by cascading glaciers create an inspiring view. This view, however, can only be seen about twenty days a year when the weather is fair. The mountain is called Fairweather because you can only see the full glory and beauty of the mountain when the fog clears.
%Author, John Eldredge, uses Fairweather Mountain as an illustration to describe how most people live their lives.  Much of our confusion results from a failure to understand the truth proclaimed in Proverbs 4:23 and other Scriptures that describe the significance of the heart. In this brief passage, the wise king Solomon identified four principles of guarding our heart.\footnote{online: \href{https://www.lifeway.com/en/articles/sermon-guard-your-heart-part-1-proverbs-4}{Guard Your Heart}}
