\subsection{Devotional from Bryan Chapell}

\subsubsection{Psalm 3}

The summer after his junior year of college, a young man I once knew had an experience that left him reeling. A singular act left him in an agonizing state of despair, because deep down in his heart he believed his failure would forever characterize him. He lost hope in the future, because he believed he could not be free of his past.\\
\\
\noindent But believers don’t have to live in such fear or despair. The Bible says that “God is the One who lifts my head high.” He takes no delight in bowing you before the regrets of your past. You may feel guilty, but remember that God’s grace frees you from guilt, because Jesus Christ paid the penalty for all your sins.\\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Prayer:} Lord, I’m thankful that I don’t have to despair over my past but rather can rejoice in your forgiveness and grace in Christ.
