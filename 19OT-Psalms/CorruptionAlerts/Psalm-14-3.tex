\multicolumn{2}{p{4.0in}}{{To start off with, here are Origen and his buddies sitting down in A.D. 200 and adding Romans 3:13 to Psalm 14:4 verbatim. After this, the stupid ``godly'' scholars pretend that Paul was reading a Greek Old Testament written more than one hundred years after he was dead.  Verse 3 in the LXX says, ``Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps ....''  The writer of this verse in the Psalms wrote it in A.D. 330 and copied it directly out of the New Testament into the Old Testament, thus adding to all of the Hebrew texts. To this day, every professor on the staff of every major Christian school in the world believes that Paul quoted a manuscript written AFTER the Council of Nicaea.\cite{Ruckman1992psalms}}} \\ \end{tabular}
