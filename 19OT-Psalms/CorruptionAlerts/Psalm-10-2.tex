\multicolumn{2}{p{4.3in}}{{Modern translations, obscure the reference to the Antichrist, identified elsewhere in scripture as the ``Wicked''.  Renderings in the modern versions seem to be speaking of a group, referred to as ``the wicked.'' Even the NIV can be read as a man in general or man in general as opposed to a specific person. The AV reading further refers to a singular man, but then a plural (``them'') is used. The second part of verse 2 could be about the followers of the man named in the first part. NIV completely botches the second part of the verse. Consider, further, the differences between devices, schemes, and plots.}} \\ \end{tabular}
