\multicolumn{2}{p{4.3in}}{{Modern versions change the grievous works of ``the wicked'' to ``prosperous'', removing all the cross references in scripture (variants of grievous occur 47 times in the AV).  From the point of view of God's people, all the works of ``the Wicked'' are grievous, and not prosperous.}} \\ %\hline
